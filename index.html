      How to Draw a Face from the Front - Step By Step
    </h1>
    <h4>
      We'll first discuss Loomis' approach, which is more complex, but more
      accurate. If you find that this approach is a bit difficult for you, you
      can skip to the simpler approach further down the page. Remember, either
      way, the goal is to create a convincing drawing of a face so either
      approach you take is fine.

    <h2>Step 1 - Draw a Circle and a Cross</h2>
    <p>
      We'll first draw a circle with two intersecting lines that connect
      directly in the center. The circle represents the top portion of the head.
      We'll use the intersecting lines to determine the locations of the facial
      features.
    </p>

    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 2 - Draw a Square within the Circle</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we'll draw a square in which each corner touches the circle. This
      square will eventually represent the edges of the face. The top line will
      eventually become the bottom hairline. The bottom line will become the
      nose line, while the center line will become the brow line.
    </p>

    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 3 - Draw the Chin</h2>
    <p>
      Now we'll measure the distance from the center line to the bottom line.
      You can use your pencil to do this. From the bottom line of the square,
      use this measurement to mark the location of the bottom of the chin. Then,
      draw the edges of the chin from each side of the square so that they
      connect at your marked location.
    </p>

    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 4 - Locate the Eyes</h2>
    <p>
      Now we have the basic structure of the shape of the face in place. We'll
      next locate the eyes. We can use the height of the head to help us
      determine the location of the eyes on the face. The eyes are generally
      found on a line in the center of the head.
      <br />
      <br />
      The brow line is represented by the center line that we drew in step one.
      So we know that the eyes should be found just below this line, in the
      center of the head. We can draw a line here for the "eye line".
    </p>

      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 5 - Draw the Eyes</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we know where our eyes are located on the face, we can draw them.
      There's another measurement to keep in mind. We also should consider the
      width of the eyes. The width of the head, from ear to ear, generally
      measures the same length of five "eyes". This means that if we want to
      draw the eyes with accurate proportions, then we need to draw them so that
      they match this approximate measurement.
    </p>

    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 6 - Locate and Draw the Nose</h2>
    <p>
      Moving down the face, we'll next draw the nose. The bottom of the nose can
      be found on the bottom line of the square that we drew in step two. The
      width of the nose varies from person to person, but is generally as wide
      as the inside corners of the eyes.
      <br />
      <br />
      It may be helpful to draw two light lines down from the inside corners of
      the eyes to help you find the width of the nose.
    </p>

      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 7 - Locate and Draw the Mouth</h2>
    <p>
      We find the mouth slightly higher than half-way between the bottom of the
      nose and the chin. Of course, this measurement varies from person to
      person. We can draw a line to mark the positioning of the mouth.
      <br />
      <br />
      We can use the eyes to help us determine the width of the mouth. The
      corners of the mouth generally align with the inside edges of the pupils.
      It may be helpful to draw light lines from the pupils to the "mouth line".
    </p>

      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 8 - Draw the Ears</h2>
    <p>
      Next, we'll draw the ears. Here again, we can use the locations of the
      features of the face to help us determine the location of the ears. The
      top of the ears will generally align with the brow line, while the bottom
      of the ears align with the nose line.
      <br />
      <br />
      Keep in mind that the ears come out of the head and extend upward
      slightly. This means that the ears will extend outward from the head, near
      the eye line.
    </p>

      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 9 - Draw the Hairline</h2>
    <p>
      Now we'll draw the hairline. If you're drawing someone that has long hair
      that overlaps the forehead, the hairline may not be visible, but it's
      still important to know where it's located. The hairline is found on the
      top edge of the square that we drew in step two.
      <br />
      <br />
      Hairlines vary greatly from person to person. In this example, we'll draw
      a widow's peak pattern.
    </p>

      alt="image"
      height="500"
      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 10 - Draw the Hair</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we have the hairline in place, we can draw the hair. Shorter hair
      extends only slightly off of the top of the head, while longer or bushier
      hair may extend quite a bit. In both cases, however, the hair extends out
      from the head and should not be drawn directly on the head.
    </p>

      width="500"
    />
    <br />
    <h2>Step 11 - Add the Neck</h2>
    <p>
      Now we need to add a neck to our floating head. The tendency of most
      beginning artists is to make the neck too narrow. Generally speaking, the
      neck extends down from the bottom of the ears. Female necks are slightly
      more slender, while the necks of males are broader.
      <br />
      <br />
      To draw the neck, we'll simply extend two lines down from the bottom of
      the ears.

      And that's it, young artist! You now have a perfect drawing of a face.
      Very well done!
